# Request for Metasploit Module?
Want an IRC bot pwned or you have an exploit for an IRC bot that you want to be ported to msf? Contact me at shipcodez@gmail.com

I am always open for suggestions and new modules as long as you give me details and analysis of a new IRC bot in the wild. Save the world from cavities!!!
